            <p>My interest in IT stems from the fact that it provides an opportunity to combine my analytical abilities with my creative abilities. 
            As far as I am concerned, technology has no limits. The technology industry has proven to be a rewarding career that enables me to 
            learn new skills on a daily basis. Having the ability to combine technical knowledge with interpersonal skills makes IT support technicians 
            an important member of any organization's team. Since my brother studied in the United States five years ago, I am familiar with information 
            technology. As a result, he explained to me what IT is and how it is used in the real world. It has been since then that I have gained some 
            knowledge in the field of website development. Additionally, I have been trained in the use of WordPress as a tool for creating commercial websites.</p>

            <p>Melbourne is regarded as one of the top ten most liveable cities in the world, and RMIT's main campus is located in the heart of the city. 
            RMIT welcomes a large number of international students from different countries yearly, especially Vietnamese students, which ranks among 
            the top five in the nation for its international exchange programs. Being exposed to people with different values and beliefs will help me 
            overcome language barriers among fellow international students and improve my social skills. Additionally, RMIT offers a balanced curriculum 
            that balances theory with practice. I believe that this would be a valuable way to enhance the learning process by providing more practical experience. </p>

            <p>To advance my career in the computing field, I need to develop the necessary knowledge and skills. It is also possible for me to enhance my knowledge and 
            skills in the field of information technology as a result of this degree program. As part of this particular degree program, I will get the opportunity to 
            gain a thorough understanding of the theory behind how computers work and how certain programs function without being dependent on any particular hardware, 
            software, or vendor while attending this study. In this way, my knowledge and skills will prepare me well for a career in information technology and provide 
            me with better employment opportunities in the future. </p>
