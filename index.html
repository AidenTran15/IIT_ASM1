          <h2 class="body-title"> Personal Information</h2>
          <p class="content">As a whole, my full name is Tuan Kiet Tran, but I am more commonly known by my nickname Aiden. My student ID is 3827472. 
            Since I am originally from Vietnam, I can speak both Vietnamese and English. I have lived in Australia for three years. Prior to attending 
            university, I completed Foundation Studies. As a transfer student from a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, this will be my second course. 
            As a result, I am swapping because I feel I am not aligned with the algorithm. Algorithms and mathematics are challenging for me. Covid 19 has 
            made it impossible for me to return to my hometown since I moved here. Vietnamese cuisine is often referred to as stylish and unique. A large 
            population and a high number of motorbikes are other attributes associated with Vietnam. Furthermore, I am also passionate about cars in 
            addition to computers. From a young age, I have been fascinated by cars. There is nothing I enjoy more than learning about engines and what 
            goes on under the hood of a vehicle. Other hobbies that I enjoy include reading, watching movies, and traveling.</p>

              <h6>Why I am interested in IT?</h6>
              <p>My interest in IT stems from the fact that it provides an opportunity to combine my analytical abilities with my creative abilities. 
                As far as I am concerned, technology has no limits. The technology industry has proven to be a rewarding career that enables me to 
                learn new skills on a daily basis. Having the ability to combine technical knowledge with interpersonal skills makes IT support technicians 
                an important member of any organization's team. Since my brother studied in the United States five years ago, I am familiar with information 
                technology. As a result, he explained to me what IT is and how it is used in the real world. It has been since then that I have gained some 
                knowledge in the field of website development. Additionally, I have been trained in the use of WordPress as a tool for creating commercial websites.</p>

              <h6>Why did I Choose rmit?</h6>
              <p>Melbourne is regarded as one of the top ten most liveable cities in the world, and RMIT's main campus is located in the heart of the city. 
                RMIT welcomes a large number of international students from different countries yearly, especially Vietnamese students, which ranks among 
                the top five in the nation for its international exchange programs. Being exposed to people with different values and beliefs will help me 
                overcome language barriers among fellow international students and improve my social skills. Additionally, RMIT offers a balanced curriculum 
                that balances theory with practice. I believe that this would be a valuable way to enhance the learning process by providing more practical experience. </p>
            </section>
            <section id="example-4">
              <h6>What do I expect to learn at RMIT?</h6>
              <p>To advance my career in the computing field, I need to develop the necessary knowledge and skills. It is also possible for me to enhance my knowledge and 
                skills in the field of information technology as a result of this degree program. As part of this particular degree program, I will get the opportunity to 
                gain a thorough understanding of the theory behind how computers work and how certain programs function without being dependent on any particular hardware, 
                software, or vendor while attending this study. In this way, my knowledge and skills will prepare me well for a career in information technology and provide 
                me with better employment opportunities in the future. </p>

                <h6>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h6>
                <p>The ESFP personality is characterized by a high level of creativity. As a means of expressing themselves and conveying my emotions to others, 
                  I frequently use art and other media. There is no doubt that each individual leaves a positive impression wherever I go. Since I am extroverted, 
                  I enjoy interacting with others in social settings and spreading optimism and enthusiasm. It is common for ESFPs to be supportive of my friends and 
                  family members. It is always possible to count on them for assistance when I am in need. Due to the fact that I do not have to adhere to a schedule, 
                  I am always prepared to meet new challenges when I arise at the last minute. I am able to maintain a positive attitude and achieve my goals without 
                  becoming overwhelmed by the tasks at hand because of my confidence and skills.</p>

                <h6>Strenghts</h6>
                <p>Extraversion means that I enjoy spending time with other people, participating in social activities, and making new friends. Whenever I meet new people, 
                  I am eager to learn about their lives and learn about their experiences. The difference between introversion and extrovertism exists in the tendency for 
                  introverts to think before speaking, while extroverts tend to speak in order to explore and organize their thoughts and ideas. As a result of the difficulties 
                  and troubles that people experience, I am often more able to let them roll off my back, despite the difficulties and troubles they may face.</p>

                <h6>Weaknesses</h6>
                <p> I am often unable to plan their futures because I prefer to live in the present moment. My daily routines may cause me to lose sight of my long-term responsibilities 
                  as I become immersed in the excitement of my daily lives.  I am constantly in search of excitement, but if I cannot find it, I may become bored very quickly. Thus, 
                  I may engage in irresponsible behavior and make irresponsible decisions. I may also experience difficulties in relationships as a result of this tendency.</p>

                <h6>Team Composition</h6>
                <p>Having fun together as a team is part of caring for one another, sharing work, and sharing responsibilities. Friendliness and warmth are exhibited by me as I 
                  listen to what teammates are trying to accomplish, ask questions in order to gain a better understanding. Though I am often concerned about what they want when 
                  they want it, I trive hard to consider other people's viewpoints as well. In order to become a valuable member of the team, I will make an effort to become actively 
                  involved in.</p>

                  learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning. As a visual learner, you are usually neat and 
                  clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions 
                  and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to color and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.</p>

                  others and work to make the world a better place. You rarely do anything that does not have a payoff in kindness or caring. You are unconcerned with selfish goals,

          <p class="p-IIT">You are a soccer enthusiast? Are you having trouble finding your playground and teammates? SportsMates will be an excellent solution for you. 
            This software enables you to search for soccer matches, find teammates and book online. Saving you time and convenience in finding your playground. Sportsmates 
            also assists field owners with field management. Finding your field will be easier because SportsMates will help you find fields near your location. SportsMates 
            also has other features is allowing you to create your own matches and find new players. Additionally, SportsMate will let you know which matches are 
            missing players so you can join them.</p>
          <h6 id="motivation">Motivation</h6>
          <p class="p-IIT">When I was in high school, I played soccer a lot, it was up to 3 to 4 times per week. The problem we often faced was that all the soccer fields 
            were full and we did not know which ones were available at that time. It took us a while to check each field individually. We had difficulty getting a field 
            to play on because it took so much time and effort. SportsMates was created for this reason. Soccer is considered the king sport among sports. According to 
            the data recorded in 2021, there were 3.4 billion people in the world who knew and followed soccer and more than a billion players. I conducted a survey about 
            the problems and difficulties of football players 2 months ago. There were 126 people who responded and nearly 50% of those people had inconveniences about 
            placing a football field. Through the above data, I have confidence that my project is a potential one and is supported by everyone.</p>
          <h6 id="description">Description</h6>
          <p class="p-IIT">Our application will focus development on two main sections. The first one is the searching and booking of soccer field sections for users. 
            Next, we will provide the soccer field owners with a customized application to be able to receive the user's booking request. In addition, this applicationwill 
            helps soccer field owners manage and arrange their fields. This can help them optimize the rental time of their fields, which can minimize the problem of vacant 
            fields during peak hours. Fields owners often have problems with players booking by mobile phone but not coming to play at the booked time. This affects the owner 
            of the soccer field who cannot arrange and optimize their fields. When booking through our application, users will have to make a deposit of at least 30% via online 
            payment applications. Thus, the owners will feel more secure when receiving the deposit and personal information of the user. Our application will have a cancellation 
            feature for users in case of an unforeseen situation. The user will have to cancel 2 hours before the start of the rental, and the deposit will be refunded to the user. 
            In case the user cancels after 2 hours before the rental time, the user cannot get the deposit back. Each user will have 100 moral points. If a user deliberately books 
            a field and does not arrive, we will have warnings and penalties. These people will have their moral points reduced and if their score is under 50, they will be banned 
            from booking or hosting matches.The software will be integrated with the map so users will be able to easily see the empty fields around them. When the user presses on 
            the field they are interested in. All information about that field will be displayed, including course name, address, phone number, field type (fields for 5 players, 
            fields for 7 players, or field for 11 players), and available hours. Users can also see the matches that are lacking people to participate in. Users can also rate and 
            give feedback about the quality and service of that football field after using it. Fields with the highest rating will be suggested on our software. SportsMaster also 
            has a filter to help users easily find a suitable field for them. This filter helps users to filter information such as location, price, field type, and field with 
            available time that the user looking. In our application, we always suggest the field that is closest to the user's location, saving users time in finding the field. 
            In order to ensure user quality, users must fill in their full names, phone numbers, email addresses, and ID cards(this can be car license, passport, student card or 
            identify card) when registering an account. The SportsMates online field booking application offers quick and easy use, along with a variety of information about soccer fields, 
            helping users no longer have to worry about the quality and saving time in looking for a field that fits their needs.</p>
          <h6 id="skill-required">Skill Required</h6>
          <p class="p-IIT">In order to successfully develop and launch SportsMates, various knowledge and skills across different areas are needed. In the first place, I will use AWS 
            services with best practices for backend computing, and databases to optimize resiliency, robustness, performance and availability. The services are AWS Lambda, AWS DynamoDB, 
            AWS API Gateway, and S3 to name a few. They will be utilized to create our infrastructure via CDK (Cloud Development Kit) which allows me to easily develop, test, maintain and 
            deploy it to AWS as code. In addition, User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design are crucial skills when designing an application's interface. A cybersecurity skill is 
            necessary because it helps secure information and ensures that mobile applications are safe to use. Aside from technology knowledge, we also need business skills to ensure that the 
            application is able to operate sustainably. For example, Marketing skills can be used to advertise a project and promotional strategies can be used to obtain users.</p>
          <h6 id="technologies">Technologies</h6>
          <p class="p-IIT">First and foremost, I want to be able to quickly build a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) to fish for your feedback on main features; therefore, practical knowledge 
            of modern web technologies and programming languages is needed. Specifically, they are Typescript, NextJs, NextUI, React Query, and Playwright for front-end development and testing. 
            In addition to that, it's critical for this app to be mobile-friendly and accessible. Therefore, PWA (Progressive Web App) technology will be used in the early stage to save time on 
            development and release. Swift and Kotlin are needed in a later stage to develop native mobile apps. These modern technologies offer out-of-the-box best frontend practices for developer 
            experiences that allow me to focus on building what matters most to the users, user-friendly features that solve users' problems. In order to iterate quickly on my product, it's crucial 
            for my development workflow to have effective and reliable CI/CD pipelines. For the front-end, skills in GitHub Actions, AWS Codebuild, and bash scripting are required for this project.</p>
          <h6 id="outcome">Outcome</h6>
          <p class="p-IIT">In the event that SportsMates performs as expected and is supported by people and society. There will be widespread recognition and influence for SportsMates on the market. 
            There will be an appreciation for SportsMates among the public as an app that makes placing soccer fields easier. A number of previously difficult problems will be solved at SportsMates, 
            including the inability to book online, the inconvenience of finding an empty field, and especially helping individuals who can find matches to join and make new teammates. By developing 
            the SportsMates app, it will be possible to increase people's desire to play soccer.
